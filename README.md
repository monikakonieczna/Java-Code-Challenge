# Java-Code-Challenge
### Challenge 1 - Even or odd
> Create a function that verifies if a number is even. 
If the number is even, the function should return true. 
If odd, the function should return false. 
The input will always be an integer. Write unit tests - all should pass.

### Challenge 2 - Password complexity
> Create a function that verifies password complexity. 
> In order for a password to be valid, it must have at least six characters, one upper case letter, 
> one lowercase letter, and one number. The function will take a string as input and output a Boolean, 
> representing whether the password is complex enough.

### Challenge 3 - Double or nothing
>A user will start off with 10 points and throughout the game, 
> the user has the option to take a chance to double their points. 
> Or, walk away with their current point value. 
> If the user decides to gamble their points in the chance of doubling, 
> the program should use randomness to decide whether the points get doubled or the user loses it all.

### Challenge 4 - Calculate water bill
>Calculate the amount owed, given the water usage.
> It's time to calculate the water bill for your apartment. 
> Your water bill consists of two parts. 
> First, there is a minimum charge of $18.84. This includes 1,496 gallons of water, or two CCFs. One CCF is equal to 748 gallons. 
> If you use more than the included two CCFs, you are charged an extra $3.90 per additional CCF. 
> This means if you use 1800 gallons of water in a given month, you will be charged the minimum $18.84, 
> as well as an additional $3.90 for the extra volume of water used. 
> For simplicity, we're not including tax in these calculations.

### Challenge 5 - Model a person
> Write a Java class that represents a person. 
> The Person class should have a first name, last name, and age attribute with their own getters and setters. 
> It should also have functionality for the person to introduce themselves. 
> Using the Person class, you will create several Person instances that introduce themselves.
